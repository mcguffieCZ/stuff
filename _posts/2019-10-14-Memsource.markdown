# Projects



Projects are the central *elemen*t of Memsource. Projects are where [jobs](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003691852-Jobs), [translation memories](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003692212-Translation-Memories), and [term bases](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003681851-Term-Bases) are combined. Translating a file using Memsource always requires a project.

#### Analysis

Set the default analysis for your project. ****

> **Note:** The Analysis setting is connected to the *Job Analysis* window. Any changes made in *Job Analysis* settings will be saved in *Project* settings and vice versa. 

For more help, see [Analysis](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002826872-Analysis).

#### Pre-translation

Set the default pre-translation for your project. As with project analysis, this setting is connected to the *Job Pre-translation* window so that any changes made in the *Job Pre-translation* settings will be saved in the *Project* settings and vice versa. For more details, see our [Pre-translate](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002841231-Pre-translate-jobs) article.

#### Project Status Automation

Project Status Automation rules enable users to configure when a project‘s status should be automatically changed. Project Status Automation rules can be saved in a [project template](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003483952-Project-Templates) and used together with an [Automation Widget](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003941812-Automation-Widget) or with [Automated Project Creation](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003460931-How-to-setup-and-use-the-Automated-Project-Creation) to achieve a completely automated process without a Project Manager’s involvement.

All options are deselected by default and can be modified on the account level in *Setup*, and on the project level in [Project Settings](https://help.memsource.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003680771-Projects#Project_Settings_1). The options are as follows:

- Set the project to **Assigned** once all jobs are **Emailed**
- Set the project to **Assigned** once all jobs are **Accepted**
- Set the project to **Completed** once all jobs are **Completed**
- Set the project to **Completed** once all jobs are **Delivered**
- Set the project to **Cancelled** once all jobs are **Cancelled**
- Set the project to **Completed** once the project is **Completed by Vendor**
