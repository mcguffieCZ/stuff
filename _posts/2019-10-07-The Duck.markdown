# Mike's Duck

1. Get a duck (no innards).

2. Set oven to 150 C.

3. Prick the skin of the duck all over the breast and thighs. Be careful not to prick the meat. This lets the fat escape when it renders.

4. Mix together a good three spoons of salt (more that you think you need), a couple spoons of kmin (Czech kmin, not cumin) and a spoon of freshly ground pepper.

   > **Note:** You can play with the spices as you like. I've played with cinnamon, ginger, different citrus, honey over the skin.

5. Rub a third of the spice mix inside the cavity of the duck and the rest over the outside of the duck.

6. Slice half an orange into six pieces, stick in the duck.

7. Place the duck breast-side down in the roasting pan and set it in the oven for an hour.

8. After the hour, turn over the duck and back in for two more hours.

9. Whack the oven up to full and turn on the overhead fan in the oven for a final ten minutes to crisp up the skin.... watch it doesn't burn.

10. Take out of the oven, let sit 10 minutes on a place.

11. Cut up the duck and eat that thing.

    > **Note:** You can use the drippings over your dumplings or potatoes. If there is a lot of fat, strain it and keep it to fry potatoes some day.
