# Memsource notes:

## Projects page

- Need separation as to what is procedure and what is concept.
- Perhaps break up the page for user roles (apply to whole doc set) i.e.: "I am a translator and I need to..." "I administrate translators and I need..."
- Need separation for 'notes'.
- Consistency in external references 'consult', 'see', 'for more details'.
- Stronger use of imperative.
- Filter and Project Column Customization
  - Do you really need to tell your customers how to use the interface? The UI seems universal to me.
- Project Dashboard
  - Also seems like UI description.
- "When creating or editing a project, the following fields are available:"
  - Hopefully, self evident. This kind of thing can be used when there are more options and only the correct selection shows you what you need as a confirmation of the right step taken. Here is redundant.

## Release Notes

I don't mind them so much as is. 

- A bit more consistent formatting.
- An option to see all the notes in one page so users can see overall development with less clicking.
- Known issues (acknowledges known problems - transparency)
- (nice to have) Doc changes
